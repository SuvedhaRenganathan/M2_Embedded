# ALCOHOL DETECTION SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION
  Now a days, many accidents are happening because of the alcohol consumption.To overcome such accidents which is one of the most significant problems in near future this system implemented aims at reducing the road accident due to drunken and drive by detecting the alcohol by the alcohol sensor from the person driving.After the detection of alcohol it displays the result in LCD and an buzzer/led glows to denote the dangerous consumption of alcohol.All these are connected with a microcontroller by this way we can reduce the accidents occured due to alcohol consumption.

## 4W's and 1H

When  - It can be used when police officers check the person who is driving had consumed alcohol or not
Where - It used in the checking panels/booth of police control in the roads to prevent accidents
Who   - Peoples,Police officers
What  - Use to detect the alcohol consumption and display the results
