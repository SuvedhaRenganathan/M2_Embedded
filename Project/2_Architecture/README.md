## COMPONENTS
### 1.ARDUINO BOARD
The arduino board is the central unit of the system. The arduino uno is the microcontroller board based on the ATmega 328.

### 3.ULTRASONIC SENSOR (HC-SR04)
The Ultrasonic sensor is the basic sensor that we use to determine the distance of an object. In another way we can say that it is used to measure how far away the object is located from a particular reference point. It has basically 4 pins;
Trig pin,Echo pin,GND pin,VCC pin (+5V)

### 4.SERVO MOTOR
These are a special kind of motors which are employed for very specific movement at a particular angle. It is a rotary or linear actuator that permits precise control at certain angular or linear positions. Servo motor is not a single entity but a combination of a suitable motor along with a sensor which gives the feedback of the current position of the motor.
